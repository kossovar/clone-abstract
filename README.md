# clone-abstract

Hello there! Abstract is a simple, minimal layout website. The idea of the Abstract Clone is to basically create a clone that is the closest look to the original site, for learning purposes. You can find Abstract and challenge yourself aswell in this link: https://www.frontendpractice.com/projects/abstract .

Thanks for viewing!
